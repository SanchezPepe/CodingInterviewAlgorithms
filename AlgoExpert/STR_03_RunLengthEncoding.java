/*
	This can be solved by traversing the string just once.
	We need to create a counter = 0
	Taking a = a[i] and b = a[i+1] if a == b there are two possible options:
		1. If counter == 9, we need to add "9/a[i]/" and reset the counter to 0
		2. If counter<8, we increment counter by 1 and move to the next letter.
	If a != b means we need to encode the characters with its number of occurences and reset it.

	TC. O(n)
	SC. O(2n) => O(n)
